# Yahoo Attachment Downloader Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension is designed to monitor your Yahoo inbox for incoming emails with attachments and automatically download the attachments as soon as they arrive. It will then repeat the process to ensure you never miss any important attachments in your emails.

## Installation

1. Download the extension files from the GitHub repository: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/ShahrozAtiq/yahoo-mail-monitor)

3. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` using the address bar.

4. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch located in the top right corner of the page.

5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer Mode.

6. Select the folder where you unzipped the extension files and click "Select."

7. The Yahoo Inbox Attachment Downloader extension will now be added to your Chrome browser.

## How it Works

The extension runs in the background while you use your Chrome browser. It continuously checks your Yahoo inbox for any new emails with attachments.

Whenever a new email with an attachment arrives, the extension will automatically download the attachment to your default download folder without any user intervention.

The process repeats itself, ensuring that any new emails with attachments are promptly saved to your computer.
